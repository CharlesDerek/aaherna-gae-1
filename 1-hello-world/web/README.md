WORKING ON:

Fixing function in ~blog.php line 26 where infocards are not dynamic in width for smaller or lager text.
- make text work with smaller titles and body text
- add a variable for href link to pass through function

WORKING ON:

To get you started, we have created a small hello world application.

1) Open the hello-world.php file

2) Follow the run instructions in the file's comments

3) If you want to look at the Apache logs, check out ~/lib/apache2/log

And that's all there is to it! Just have fun. Go ahead and edit the code, 
or add new files. It's all up to you! 

Happy coding!
